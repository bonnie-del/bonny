<h1>kisii culture</h1>
<p>The Kisii believe in ancestral spirits. In the past, displeased ancestral spirits were believed to be responsible for diseases, the death of people and livestock, and the destruction of crops. The Kisii conduct funerals at the departed person's homestead, where a large gathering is a sign of prestige.</p>
